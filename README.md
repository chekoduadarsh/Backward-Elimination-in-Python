# Backward-Elimination
Backward elimination starts with all of the predictors in the model. The variable that is least significant--that is, the one with the largest P value--is removed and the model is refitted. Each subsequent step removes the least significant variable in the model until all remaining variables have individual P values smaller than some value, such as 0.05 or 0.10.
